solve the following in .h and .cpp format

Create a class VehicleData with the following attributes

  -alphanumeric vehicleID
  -string for VehicleModel
  different.h and display for enum
  -enumeration literals of SEDAN, SUV & HATCHBACK for the vehicle type
  -integer value for fuelTankCapacity
  -decimal number for mileage (expected as per company)

 

  -required constructors
  -ability to gain read write access to data members
  -ability to display all data members
  -ability to add 2 VehicleData objects together to return combined fuelTankCapacity


  Create 3 lambda functions to do the following 

   -Calculate AverageFuelCapacity from all VehicleData objects passed in a container and return the answer
   -find mileage of vehicle with a given vehicle ID and return the answer
   -

Store both function into a list of std::function type

Create a function operation that takes VehicleData objects in a container  and 
a container containig all the function objects.
