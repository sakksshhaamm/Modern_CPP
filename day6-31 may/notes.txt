3 major ways (styles or paradigms) of programming

# structure oriented (imperative programming)

    [small script or simple program with small scale ]

        (block or structure oriented ,programs focus on isolating logic in various blocks)

# object oriented :template and instance of templates

    [software based links or associations between things,abstraction and encapsulation is priority]

# Functional programming

[process data by performing operations on collection of data]


principles of functional proramming

(all based on the idea that idea is supposed to be immutable

and

    functions are supposed to be treated as a variable of another type )

    1)variable have a type

    -functions should also have a type

    2)variables can be passed to function

        functions should also be allowed as a parameter

    3)variables van be returned from function

        functions can also be returned from a function

    4)variables can be stored in collection of some type

        -functions should also get stored in data containers

    5)variables can be copied

        -functions should also get copied
